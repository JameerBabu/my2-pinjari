### My favorite vaction spot - Srisailam

Srisailam is the abode of **Lord Mallikarjuna** and **Maa Bhramaraambamika**. It's been my vacation spot since my childhood. My family is an advert devotee to Lord Shiva and goes to temple atleast once a year. After I grew up, my mother and father started taking me to Srisailam whenever they go. It has nice scenary with **Patala Ganga waterfalls**, **Juraala Waterdam**. It does provide a home for tigers called Srisailam Tiger Reserve. **Nallamalla** forest which surrounds the place gives the feeling of heaven while travelling.
